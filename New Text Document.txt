--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Context
Currently there are no precise theoretical methods to predict mechanical properties of steels. All the methods available are by backed by statistics 
and extensive physical testing of the materials. Since testing each material with different composition is a highly tedious task (imagine the number 
of possibilities!), let's apply our knowledge of machine learning and statistics to solve this problem.

Content
This dataset contains compositions by weight percentages of low-alloy steels along with the temperatures at which the steels were tested and the 
values mechanical properties observed during the tests. The alloy code is a string unique to each alloy. Weight percentages of alloying metals and 
impurities like Aluminum, copper, manganese, nitrogen, nickel, cobalt, carbon, etc are given in columns. The temperature in celsius for each test is 
mentioned in a column. Lastly mechanical properties including tensile strength, yield strength, elongation and reduction in area are given in separate
columns. The dataset contains 915 rows.

Inspiration
The challenge is to predict the mechanical properties using the alloy composition and temperature.

TODO



1. First, dropping ceq later, drop wverything but ceq

2. For now dropping code column but later try to figure out what it is and then try to generate codes of new alloy base on the nomenclature

find some random data on google to test the model

**********************
try to do reverse engg.
with given tensile strength try to predict compositions

**************************
how compositions and elements are determined?

***************************
role of each element

for now displaying all values but later i can choose how i want to display it 

#########
yield is calculated after tensile
pred yield- 
1.without tensile
2.with tensile
conclusion---not much difference
